## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The topic will be how we can convert casual hover bike riders (Rebels) to annual membership holders (Imperials) for a hover bike ride-sharing company. I chose this topic because it compliments a project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) course offered by Coursera. I have always wanted to convert the R programming language project to a Tableau story but never had the time, but now is the chance to do so… with a twist!

## WHY
•	**Business Case/Other Goals** - The Director of Marketing at LightSpeeders, Darth Vader, believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual hover bike riders (Rebels) and annual members (Imperials) use LightSpeeders hover bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert Rebels into Imperials. But first, LightSpeeders executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

•	**Intended Outcome** – LightSpeeders’ finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders, who consist of single-use riders and full-day riders. Darth Vader believes that maximizing the number of Imperials will be key to future growth and he believes there is a very good chance to Rebels into Imperials.
